Create a Web COVID-tracking application.  It should allow people (health workers and confirmed cases) and venues to register their details, and for people to select a venue and check in and out (record start and end time). 

**Project Definition of Done**
- [ ] All tests produced throughout the implementation of user stories should pass
- [ ] All errors/exceptions must be handled
- [ ] The GUI should display all required information without unnecessary details
- [ ] Documentation should be up to date and the stakeholder review should be successful

**User Story Definition of Done**
 - [ ] The user story must have tests in place which check boundary values and will test for relevant exceptions
 - [ ] These tests must pass
 - [ ] The relevant feature should be clearly accessible via the GUI and should be able to call the relevant method/feature
